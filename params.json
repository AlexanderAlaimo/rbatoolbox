Is has been developed by three master's students in Engineering Acoustics at the Technical\r\nUniversity of Denmark.\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou are free to use this toolbox in any way you want but please give credit when using large parts of the code. Use e.g. \r\nthis as reference:\r\n\r\nLylloff, O., Nielsen, M. and Duhalde, D. The RBA toolbox. https://github.com/RBAtoolbox\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIf you don't expect to use the RBA toolbox for measurements, then it can be installed by downloading and dropping the \r\nfolder RBAtoolbox into your MATLAB root folder. Remember to add RBAtoolbox to your path.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to do measurements, then you need to install Psychtoolbox http://psychtoolbox.org/HomePage .
